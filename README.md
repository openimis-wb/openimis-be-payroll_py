## Digital Means of Payment Configuration

This section details the configuration settings required for integrating with a digital payment gateway. The settings are defined in the application's configuration file (`apps.py`).

### Configuration Parameters

- **gateway_base_url**: The base URL of the payment gateway's API.
  - Example: `"http://41.175.18.170:8070/api/mobile/v1/"`

- **endpoint_payment**: The endpoint for processing payments.
  - Example: `"mock/payment"`

- **endpoint_reconciliation**: The endpoint for reconciling payments.
  - Example: `"mock/reconciliation"`

- **payment_gateway_api_key**: The API key for authenticating with the payment gateway. It is retrieved from environment variables.

- **payment_gateway_basic_auth_username**: The username for basic authentication with the payment gateway. It is retrieved from environment variables.

- **payment_gateway_basic_auth_password**: The password for basic authentication with the payment gateway. It is retrieved from environment variables.

- **payment_gateway_timeout**: The timeout setting for requests to the payment gateway, in seconds.
  - Example: `5`

- **payment_gateway_auth_type**: The type of authentication used by the payment gateway. It can be either 'token' or 'basic'.

### Example Configuration

```python
{
    "gateway_base_url": "http://41.175.18.170:8070/api/mobile/v1/",
    "endpoint_payment": "mock/payment",
    "endpoint_reconciliation": "mock/reconciliation",
    "payment_gateway_api_key": os.getenv('PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY'),
    "payment_gateway_basic_auth_username": os.getenv('PAYMENT_GATEWAY_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME'),
    "payment_gateway_basic_auth_password": os.getenv('PAYMENT_GATEWAY_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD'),
    "payment_gateway_timeout": 5,
    "payment_gateway_auth_type": "basic",
    "payment_gateway_class": "payroll.payment_gateway.MockedPaymentGatewayConnector",
    "receipt_length": 8
}
```

### Integrating the Payment Gateway

To integrate the payment gateway, you need to define a class that extends the `PaymentGatewayConnector` and implements the necessary methods to handle payment and reconciliation requests.

### Example Implementation of Payment Gateway Integration

```python
from payroll.payment_gateway.payment_gateway_connector import PaymentGatewayConnector

class MockedPaymentGatewayConnector(PaymentGatewayConnector):
    def send_payment(self, invoice_id, amount, **kwargs):
        payload = {"invoiceId": str(invoice_id), "amount": str(amount)}
        response = self.send_request(self.config.endpoint_payment, payload)
        if response:
            response_text = response.text
            expected_message = f"{invoice_id} invoice of {amount} accepted to be paid"
            if response_text == expected_message:
                return True
        return False

    def reconcile(self, invoice_id, amount, **kwargs):
        payload = {"invoiceId": str(invoice_id), "amount": str(amount)}
        response = self.send_request(self.config.endpoint_reconciliation, payload)
        if response:
            return response.text == "true"
        return False
```

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables in your environment:

- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY`: Your API key for the payment gateway.
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME`: Your username for basic authentication.
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`: Your password for basic authentication.

You can use either basic authentication or token authentication. Set the following variable accordingly:

## Payment Point-Specific Payment Gateway Configuration

The system supports configuring different payment gateway settings for specific payment points. This feature allows organizations to work with multiple payment providers.

### Configuration Structure

Payment point-specific configurations are defined in the Django settings file under the `PAYMENT_GATEWAYS` dictionary. Each payment point has its own configuration dictionary that can override any of the global payment gateway settings:

```python
PAYMENT_GATEWAYS = {
    'payment_point_name_1': {
        'gateway_base_url': 'https://api.payment-provider1.com/v1/',
        'endpoint_payment': 'payments',
        'endpoint_reconciliation': 'reconciliation',
        'payment_gateway_auth_type': 'token',
        'payment_gateway_api_key': 'payment_point_1_api_key',
        'payment_gateway_timeout': 10,
        'payment_gateway_class': 'payroll.payment_gateway.CustomPaymentGatewayConnector'
    },
    'payment_point_name_2': {
        'gateway_base_url': 'https://api.payment-provider2.com/v2/',
        'endpoint_payment': 'process-payment',
        'endpoint_reconciliation': 'verify-payment',
        'payment_gateway_auth_type': 'basic',
        'payment_gateway_basic_auth_username': 'payment_point_2_username',
        'payment_gateway_basic_auth_password': 'payment_point_2_password',
        'payment_gateway_timeout': 15,
        'payment_gateway_class': 'payroll.payment_gateway.AlternatePaymentGatewayConnector'
    }
}
```

### Configuration Parameters

Each payment point configuration can include the following parameters:

- **gateway_base_url**: The base URL for the payment gateway API specific to this payment point.
- **endpoint_payment**: The endpoint for processing payments.
- **endpoint_reconciliation**: The endpoint for reconciling payments.
- **payment_gateway_auth_type**: The authentication method ('token' or 'basic').
- **payment_gateway_api_key**: The API key for token authentication.
- **payment_gateway_basic_auth_username**: The username for basic authentication.
- **payment_gateway_basic_auth_password**: The password for basic authentication.
- **payment_gateway_timeout**: The timeout in seconds for API requests.
- **payment_gateway_class**: The Python class that implements the payment gateway connector.

### Default Fallback

If a parameter is not specified in the payment point configuration, the system will use the global value defined in `PayrollConfig`.

### How Payment Point Configuration is Applied

When processing a payroll, the system uses the `payment_point` name on the `Payroll` model to determine which configuration to use:

1. If the `payment_point` value matches a key in the `PAYMENT_GATEWAYS` dictionary, the system uses that configuration.
2. If no matching configuration is found, or if `payment_point` is not set, the system uses the global configuration.

### Custom Payment Gateway Connector Classes

The `payment_gateway_class` parameter allows each payment point to use a different implementation for interacting with the payment gateway. This is particularly useful when different payment points need to integrate with completely different payment providers.

To create a custom connector:

1. Create a class that extends `PaymentGatewayConnector`
2. Implement the `send_payment` and `reconcile` methods
3. Specify the fully-qualified class name in the payment point configuration

Example connector implementation:

```python
from payroll.payment_gateway.payment_gateway_connector import PaymentGatewayConnector

class CustomPaymentGatewayConnector(PaymentGatewayConnector):
    def send_payment(self, invoice_id, amount, **kwargs):
        payload = {
            "reference": str(invoice_id),
            "amount": float(amount),
            "currency": "USD"
        }
        response = self.send_request(self.config.endpoint_payment, payload)
        if response and response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            return data.get('status') == 'success'
        return False

    def reconcile(self, invoice_id, amount, **kwargs):
        payload = {
            "reference": str(invoice_id),
            "amount": float(amount)
        }
        response = self.send_request(self.config.endpoint_reconciliation, payload)
        if response and response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            return {
                "transaction_id": data.get('transaction_id'),
                "status": data.get('status'),
                "timestamp": data.get('timestamp')
            }
        return False
```

### Security Considerations

Payment gateway credentials should be stored securely:

1. Do not hardcode API keys or passwords in your settings file
2. Use environment variables to store sensitive information
3. Consider using a secrets management solution for production environments

Example secure configuration:

```python
PAYMENT_GATEWAYS = {
    'secure_payment_point': {
        'gateway_base_url': os.getenv('PAYMENT_POINT_URL'),
        'payment_gateway_auth_type': 'token',
        'payment_gateway_api_key': os.getenv('PAYMENT_POINT_API_KEY')
    }
}
```

## Payment Flow for Online Payroll Payments

When the `payment_method` of a Payroll is set to `StrategyOnlinePayment`, the configuration described below is required for the payment and reconciliation process.

### Instructions for Making a Payment

1. **Populate/Generate Payroll**: Ensure the payroll has `payment_method='StrategyOnlinePayment'`.
2. **Accept or Reject Payroll**: Use the maker-checker logic to either accept or reject the payroll.
3. **Accepted Payroll**:
   - Navigate to `Legal and Finance (Payments) -> Accepted Payrolls`.
   - Click the `Make Payment` button. This triggers the payment flow defined in the configuration.
4. **Invoice Submission**:
   - If all invoices are sent successfully, go to the view reconciliation summary.
   - Invoices that were accepted will have their status changed from `Accepted` to `Approved for Payment`.
5. **Close Payroll**:
   - In the same view, click the `Accept and Close Payroll` button.
6. **Task View**:
   - Go to payroll details and click the `Tasks` view.
   - At the top of the searcher, you should see a `Reconciliation` task.
7. **Accept or Reject Task**:
   - Accept or reject the reconciliation task.
   - If accepted, the reconciliation flow is triggered. Payments are reconciled if the feedback from the payment gateway is successful without any issues. The status for the benefit will be `Reconciled`. The payroll will now be visible in `Payrolls -> Reconciled Payrolls`.
8. **Error Handling**:
   - Even if the payroll is reconciled, some benefits might not be paid due to errors.
   - The status will remain `Approved for Payment`.
   - Errors can be viewed by clicking the `Error` button.
   - Unpaid Payroll's invoices can be recreated during re-creation of payroll in reconciled payroll
9. **Recreate Unpaid Invoices**:
   - Unpaid payroll invoices can be recreated during the re-creation of payroll in the reconciled payroll section.
   - The unpaid invoices will be included in the new payroll.
   - Use the `Create Payroll from Unpaid Invoices` button available when you go to `Legal and Finance -> Reconciled Payrolls -> View Reconciled Payroll -> Create Payment from Failed Invoice`.

## BenefitConsumption Code Auto-Generation

`BenefitConsumption.code` is auto-assigned by a database trigger and sequence when `code` is `NULL` or empty. Explicitly supplied codes are preserved.

### Default format

```
BEN-YY-XXXXXXXXXX
```

Example: `BEN-26-0000000001`

### Custom code patterns

Configurable via `ModuleConfiguration`:

```json
{
  "benefit_code_pattern": "PAY-[YYYY][MM]-[SEQ:8]"
}
```

Tokens: `[SEQ:N]`, `[SEQ]`, `[YY]`, `[YYYY]`, `[MM]` — same as the invoice module. See invoice README for full token reference.

### Trigger auto-sync

The trigger is kept in sync automatically on startup, on config change (`post_save` signal), and via management command:

```bash
python manage.py sync_code_triggers --module payroll
python manage.py sync_code_triggers --dry-run
```

### Migration

`payroll/migrations/0024_benefit_bill_code_sequences.py` — uses `RunPython` with vendor detection. Fails fast on unsupported DB vendors.

To reverse: `python manage.py migrate payroll 0023`

## Payroll Bulk Creation and Lifecycle

### Payroll lifecycle

```
[create] → GENERATING → PENDING_APPROVAL   (success)
                      → FAILED              (exception during benefit generation)
```

The payroll row is committed **before** benefit generation begins so it persists even on failure. On failure, `json_ext` stores `creation_params` (original arguments) and `creation_error` (exception message).

### Retriggering a failed payroll

A `FAILED` payroll can be retriggered via the `retriggerPayroll` GraphQL mutation or `PayrollService.retrigger_creation()`. It re-reads `creation_params` from `json_ext` and re-runs benefit generation.

## Payment Flow for Offline Payroll Payments

When the `payment_method` of a Payroll is set to `StrategyOfflinePayment`, the configuration described below is required for the offline payment and reconciliation process.

### Instructions for Making an Offline Payment

1. **Create Payroll**:
   - Navigate to `Legal and Finance (Payments) -> Payrolls`.
   - Click the `+` (add payroll) button to create a new payroll.
2. **Choose Payment Method**:
   - Select `StrategyOfflinePayment` as the payment method.
3. **Accept or Reject Payroll**:
   - Use the maker-checker logic to either accept or reject the payroll.
   - Go to the `Tasks` tab on the payroll details page to perform this action.
4. **Accepted Payroll**:
   - If the payroll task is accepted, a new button `Upload Payment Data` becomes available.
   - Click `Download` to view the `invoices` attached to the payroll in CSV format.
5. **Prepare Reconciliation File**:
   - To reconcile a benefit/invoice, fill in the `Paid` column with `Yes` and generate a `Receipt` number.
   - If the payment is not made, do not add a receipt number and set the `Paid` column to `No`. Alternatively, remove the unpaid record from the file entirely.
6. **Upload Payment Data**:
   - Once the file is prepared, upload it by clicking `Upload Payment Data`.
   - After uploading, you should see the `payments` data reconciled based on the `Paid` status and the presence of a receipt number.
7. **Reconcile Payroll**:
   - Click `View Reconciliation Summary` under `Legal and Finance (Payments) -> Reconciled Payrolls`.
   - If you click `Approve and Close`, to confirm the reconciliation, go to `Tasks` either in the `All Tasks` view or on the `Payroll` page in the `Tasks` tab.
8. **Recreate Unpaid Invoices**:
   - Unpaid payroll invoices can be recreated during the re-creation of payroll in the reconciled payroll section.
   - The unpaid invoices will be included in the new payroll.
   - Use the `Create Payroll from Unpaid Invoices` button available when you go to `Legal and Finance -> Reconciled Payrolls -> View Reconciled Payroll -> Create Payment from Failed Invoice`.
